Bugs that I found using PMD application:
-------------------------------------------------

    UnnecessaryAnnotationValueElement
        - Where: 17 individual instances
        - Why: syntactically used "value=" where only a single argument presides
        - Example: (@RequestParam(value = "deptCode") String deptCode) -> (@RequestParam("deptCode") String deptCode)
        - Fixed: Yes, all 17 instances have been corrected to ensure convention

    LooseCoupling
        - Where: 20+ instances of this error
        - Why: Interface preferred over specified declaration
        - Example: HashMap deptMap = new HashMap... -> Map deptMap = new HashMap...
        - Fixed: Yes, however this seems more like preference than anything

    ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull
        - Where: MyFileDatabase.java:54
        - Why: Incorrect return type
        - Example: return null; -> return HashMap<>();
        - Fixed: Yes, single instance was corrected

    LiteralsFirstComparison
        - Where: IndividualProjectApplication.java:41
        - Why: Prevents a null pointer from occurring
        - Example: arg.equals("setup") -> "setup".equals(arg)
        - Fixed: Yes, single instance was corrected

    UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
        - Where: RouteController.java:48,RouteController.java:45
        - Why: When doing a String.toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() call, we use a Locale to insure consistency
        - Example: deptCode.toUpperCase() -> deptCode.toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH)
        - Fixed: Yes, both instances have been corrected

    UnusedLocalVariable:
        - Where: RouteController.java:291
        - Why: This whole method is a mess and the error only begins to explain why. Yes, the variable is
        unused but it actually needs to be in the code. We need this to get the correct timeSlot which wasn't
        being called either (see next error).
        - Example: The absence of requestedCourse.somethingCalledUpon() in this case:
                String courseTime = requestedCourse.getCourseTimeSlot();
        - Fixed: Yes, but only after acknowledgment of the next issue as well

    Logical Error:
        - Where: ""
        - Why: It looks as though someone might have pseudo-coded this method and neglected to replace the temp
        string holding "some time " with real data from the requestedCourse. In this case, the placeholder string
        was replaced with a call on the time slot method.
        - Example: ("The course meets at: " + "some time "... -> ("The course meets at: " + timeSlot ...
        - Fixed: Yes, fully functional

    Missing Override
        - Where: Department.java:102, Course.java:65
        - Why: Overrides the default toString() that would not suffice for either case do to specific needs outlined
        - Example: @Override toString() {...
        - Fixed: Yes, both refracted, no complications


    Note:
    There was one or two bugs I noticed all the way back to "Code Clean Up". These were conspicuous. This
    includes things like returning: return "this.department"; instead of: return this.department; or things like:
    return -this.capacity; instead of: return this.capacity; I have a general example with a specific error
    within the code for all the undocumented changes, each of which fit into one of the several categories above.


Bugs I found through assessment/analysis:
-------------------------------------------------

    Casting Error
        - Where: MyFileDatabase.java:48
        - Why: The cast was unchecked, I'm not really sure why this is giving me a warning though, as the 'if
        statement' insures that the type is indeed checked beforehand... so it is checked
        - Example: Added @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        - Fixed: Not confident, but added

    Absence of If/Else Statement
        - Where: Course.java:34 & Course.java:48
        - Why: There was no way to deal with when there is a mex or min on the current capacity so I added if/else
        statements to make sure that it didnt go below zero or above the max capacity.
        - Example: if (enrollmentCapacity > enrolledStudentCount) {...
        - Fixed: Fixed for both enrollStudent() and dropStudent

    Incorrect HTTPStatus Call
        - Where: RouteController.java:553
        - Why: It was returning OK even though it wasn't 'ok'
        - Example: HttpStatus.OK -> HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND
        - Fixed: Fixed

    Random Minus Sign
        - Where: RouteController.java:152
        - Why: This just looks like a typo
        - Example: Self explanatory
        - Fixed: Yes, fixed

    Added Javadoc Comments
        - Where: Mostly in Course.java but also one in RouteController.java
        - Why: Standard to have them for every method. Most of them did not have a comment
        - Example: See Course.java
        - Fixed: Yes, but not really a "bug"

    Edited Javadoc Comment
        - Where: Course.getCourseLocation()
        - Why: It was basically just a c/p from the method above it - not accurate
        - Example: @return true -> @return courseLocation
        - Fixed: ""

    Renamed Method
        - Where: Course.java:138
        - Why: The original method name was not very good
        - Example: See changed method name
        - Fixed: Yes, fixed and makes more sense now


    Note:
    IndividualProjectApplication.java has logic errors. There are several instances where the enrollment is
    higher that the course capacity at conception of the course/department. However, this was left as is and
    ignored due to the instructions in the file.


-------------------------------------------------
Final Note:
There were several errors that I might have automatically fixed without even noticing while trying to
understand the code that I have neglected to put here. This is because I did not know originally that this
text file would be required and that the bug fixing was much more structured. If this is a problem in the
future I will make sure to log all my changes as I go and/or go through my old commits to look for my changes.
